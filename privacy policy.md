# Privacy Policy for Kanjido

**Effective Date:** September 9, 2025

Thank you for using Kanjido ("the App"). This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the App.

**1. Information We Collect and How It's Used**

Kanjido is designed to work entirely offline and **does not collect or transmit any personal information to remote servers.** All data you input and generate within the App is stored exclusively on your local device. This includes:

*   **Event Data:** Event names, participant names, item descriptions, and amounts you enter are stored locally on your device to allow you to manage and review your shared expenses.
*   **Locally Stored Preferences:** App settings or preferences you configure (such as a saved PromptPay ID for QR generation) are stored locally on your device.
*   **Text Recognition Data (ML Kit):** If you use features that involve text recognition (e.g., "Capture Bill"), the image data is processed on your device by Google's ML Kit for text recognition. This data is processed locally and is not transmitted to us or any third party by the App.
*   **QR Code Generation:** Information used to generate QR codes (like amounts and your locally stored PromptPay ID) is processed on your device to create the QR image. This information is not transmitted from your device by the App.

**2. Data Storage**

All data entered into or generated by Kanjido is stored locally on your device's internal storage or application-specific storage. You can typically clear this data by clearing the app's data through your device's system settings or by uninstalling the App.

**3. Data Sharing and Third Parties**

We **do not share any of your personal information or app usage data with any third parties.** The App does not integrate with any third-party services for the purpose of collecting or sharing your data.

The App utilizes Google's ML Kit for on-device text recognition. Google's handling of data processed by ML Kit is subject to Google's policies. However, Kanjido itself does not transmit this data off your device.

**4. Permissions**

Kanjido may request the following permissions:

*   **Camera:** (Only if you implement the "Capture Bill" feature that uses the camera directly). This permission would be used solely to capture images of bills for on-device text recognition to extract item details. The images are processed locally and not stored permanently by the app unless explicitly saved by you within the app's local data.
    *   *(If you are NOT using the camera directly for bill capture, but only allowing users to select images from their gallery, you might not need the CAMERA permission itself, but rather storage access permissions. Adjust this section accordingly.)*
*   **Storage (Read/Write External Storage - if applicable for older Android versions or specific use cases):** If the app needs to save or read files from shared storage (e.g., exporting a summary, importing data), this would be explained here. For modern Android, scoped storage is often used, reducing the need for broad storage permissions.

**5. Children's Privacy**

Kanjido is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.

**6. Security**

We take reasonable steps to help protect the information stored locally on your device by the App. However, please remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. The security of your data also depends on the overall security of your device.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the App's Google Play Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
